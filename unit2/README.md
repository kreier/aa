## 1 Welcome to Advanced Automation! 

### 1-1 Why Automation?
[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWEEvp6krfU) - Although we hear about the negative sides of automation in today's world, learning how to use automation ourselves is essential to seeing how it can be a force for good. In this first video of the automation course this year, I want to share some of the reasons why I am optimistic about what we are going to learn this year.

### 1-2 Building Automation
For this task, there are three tools you can explore how to build your own automated solutions to problems you face. You can choose any of them. Here are three videos describing how to build with each one:
- [iOS/iPadOS - Shortcuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9fRKtmq3zo)
- [macOS Automator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2QGaVdlvys)
- [IFTTT (IF This Then That)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRLMkV-tCKQ)

Your task for the next class is to experiment with any of these tools to get a sense of how they work. Feel free to look for other tutorials out there to help you with any questions that might arise.

You must then build your own two automated tasks with any of the tools above. You should be prepared to explain the background context and the steps in the automation you build. Submit a single screenshot for each program in the assignment below.
